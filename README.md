jquery.hint.modified
====================

A fork from the great jquery.hint at (http://remysharp.com/2007/01/25/jquery-tutorial-text-box-hints/).
Here we take advantage of the HTML5's 'placeholder' attribute. 
This fork checks if there's any support for this attribute, and uses it. 
Otherwise just do what it is suposed to do.
