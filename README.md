jquery.hint.modified
====================

A fork from the great jquery.hint at (http://remysharp.com/2007/01/25/jquery-tutorial-text-box-hints/).
Here we take advantage of the HTML5's 'placeholder' attribute, yet using the plugin the same way we always do. 
This checks if there's any support for this attribute, and uses it. Otherwise just do what it is suposed to do.

Works for browsers such as IE8 and IE9, wich have no support to the 'placeholder' attribute.
